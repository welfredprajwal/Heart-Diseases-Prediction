# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
This project employs the Random Forest algorithm to predict heart disease risk based on medical data. By analyzing key health indicators like blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate, the model classifies patients into risk categories. Random Forest enhances prediction accuracy through multiple decision trees, aiding early diagnosis .(Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.)
